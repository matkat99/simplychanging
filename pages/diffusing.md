Diffusing essential oils is a quick and powerful way to influence the feeling of our environment, and, more powerfully, our own emotions. Essential oils provide a great way to quickly alter your mood. In many cases, you can start feeling the calming, soothing or uplifting effects on an essential oil from the moment you open the bottle. Inhaling essential oils allows you to quickly alter your mood because the oils will generate an emotional response within the brain from the first sniff.

When an essential oil is inhaled, it travels through the nose and is processed by the portion of the brain that is responsible for controlling our sense of smell. From there, aromatic pathways connect the scent to the part of the brain where memories and experiences are stored. As the aroma travels through aromatic pathways, memories are triggered, giving us an emotional response.

## Deep Clean Every Month

Cleaning is a necessary step to ensure that oil residue doesnâ€™t build up in your machine preventing it from working properly. Periodically, it is a good idea to run your diffuser through a cleaning cycle. If you use your unit every day, then running a cleaning cycle monthly is a good idea. To do so, do the following:

1. Fill your diffuser half way with clean water.
2. Add 10 drops of white vinegar.
3. Let the diffuser run for about 5 minutes to allow the water-vinegar mixture to disperse throughout the unit and clean it.
4. Drain the diffuser completely.
5. Using a cotton swab dipped in vinegar, clean the tight spots and corners of the diffuser.
6. Rinse with clean water.
7. Use a dry cloth to wipe the diffuser and dry it thoroughly.
