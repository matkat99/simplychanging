Did you know that essential oils are a powerful tool for supporting your emotional health? When we are in emotional distress, it affects our quality of life and how we feel each day. Emotional health affects our ability to make decisions, how we interact with others and how we show up in life. Here are 3 reasons we love using oils to help us stay happy.

- They are natural, safe substances that won’t cause harmful problems or endanger your health. Many of the substances and sources we use to manage stress or deal with our emotions can end up hurting us in other ways. Using essential oils for mood management provides a safe and simple way to deal with complex emotions that are constantly changing.

- Essential oils provide a great way to quickly alter your mood. In many cases, you can start to feel the calming, soothing, or uplifting effects of an essential oil from the moment that you open the bottle. Inhaling essential oils, applying them to the skin, or diffusing them in the air allows you to quickly alter your mood because the oil will generate an emotional response within the brain from the first sniff.

- They provide the user with a convenient way to manage mood nearly any time of day and in any location. While there are other healthy ways to manage our emotions—speaking with friends or a counselor, doing physical activities like yoga, or giving ourselves a break by taking a vacation—these options aren’t always practical right in the moment when we wish to alter our mood. However, essential oils provide a simple way to manage your emotions while at work, home, school, or in practically any circumstance.

## Favorite Ways to Use Essential Oils For Emotional Support

## Emotional Aromatherapy System

The doTERRA [Emotional Aromatherapy System](https://media.doterra.com/us/en/brochures/emotional-aromatherapy.pdf) uses the science of aromatic plant families to help us connect our emotions with specific essential oils. This is a quick and simple way to decide which oils you need. Choose your emotion(s) from the center of the wheel and use the oil(s) that’s closest to that emotion. These oils can be applied topically or diffused and are available in rollerballs.
