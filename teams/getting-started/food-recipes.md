dōTERRA essential oils, when added to your favorite foods, can create a very flavorful experience. Essential oils are great to use when fresh herbs are not available or when you forget an ingredient at the store. They are also great substitutes for dried spices. Essential oils allow you to have pure, concentrated flavor. It is best to add the oils at the end of cooking, to reduce the amount of evaporation. Baking with essential oils does not eliminate their therapeutic value. Have fun mixing and matching flavors and enjoy the beautiful aroma that cooking with essential oils brings into your kitchen.

## Favorite Essential Oils for Cooking

**Peppermint**: add to tea with honey, chocolates, brownies, popcorn
**Citrus**: all the citrus oils are great for cooking! Add to smoothies, yogurt, dips, granola.
**OnGuard**: add to baked goods, popcorn and apples.
**Lime**: use in place of lime in any recipe. Soak grapes in lime.
**Cilantro**: use instead of fresh cilantro. Just one drop.
**Oregano**: use instead of dried oregano. Dip a toothpick into your oregano and swirl the toothpick into your food, one drop is often too much.
