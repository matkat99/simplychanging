Hi friends!

We are so excited to have you here with us. We hope that you are ready to learn how to use your essential oils and see amazing things happen in your life. Youâ€™ve made an investment in your health by purchasing essential oils and we want to make sure that you know how to use these incredible gifts from the earth.

As a member of our doTERRA family, we love you and support you. This website is one of our gifts to you. We ask that you honor this gift and donâ€™t share your username and password. We would love to have all your family and friends join our doTERRA family, we want to see essential oils in everyoneâ€™s home. So share your oils and experiences with your friends and family and invite them to experience the empowerment and excitement that you are experiencing or will soon experience. We promise that these oils will change your life, if they havenâ€™t already. ðŸ™‚

How do you connect your friends to our community? You share what you love (your oils) and ask us (or the person who shared the oils with you) to help set your friends up with a wholesale membership, just like we/they did for you. ðŸ™‚ We are excited to have them become a part of our doTERRA community. ðŸ™‚

Our goal is to be with you each step of the way on your doTERRA journey. Because education is so important to using your oils, we will always be adding more information to the blog so come back each week.

Since everyone loves gifts, when you have read through all the sections under [Getting Started](/getting-started/), reach out to us and we will send you a fun oil gift.

With all this new information, questions will come up. Head on over to our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1433411416949527) and ask away! Or you can send us an email or text. ðŸ™‚

You are not on this journey alone. We are always here for you!

With much love,

[Keri and Aubrey](/contact/)
