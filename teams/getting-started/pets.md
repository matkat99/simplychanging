It’s important to keep our pets in mind as we use essential oils in our homes. Dogs and cats in particular have 200–300 million olfactory receptors (humans have only 5–6 million). Their sense of smell is very sensitive, so when you are diffusing, be sure to use a water-based diffuser like the [Lumo® diffuser](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/blog/product-spotlight-lumo-diffuser), and only diffuse with the door open so that your pet can leave the room if desired. To learn more about pets and essential oils, check out the links and infographic.

When using [oils with dogs](https://www.facebook.com/doterra/photos/a.206582864313/10159747037824314/), always dilute down to 1-2% prior to application (100 drops of carrier oil to every one drop of essential oil). Dilute even more for animals that are less than 10 pounds.
