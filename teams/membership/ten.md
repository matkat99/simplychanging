**Live Events**: (Suspended during COVID-19, but will resume some day :)) Reach out to the person who shared the oils with you to see if there are local events taking place near you. These allow you to experience essential oils first hand, ask questions and experience a community of support.

**Online Events**: Whether or not you’ve had access to local classes in the past, you now have access to virtual classes to support you. Tune into our Facebook page for targeted education on individual essential oils and wellness.

**Corporate Events**:

Throughout the year doTERRA hosts a number of [incredible events](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/events) that allow us to connect as a community and give you even more education on your essential oils.

Of all the event, our very favorite event is doTERRA’s Annual Convention!

Traditionally held in Salt Lake City, Utah, every September, this is like the most happening, exciting, and empowering family reunion that you’ll ever experience. Imagine 30,000 of your closest friends getting together for 3 days full of fun, education, science, new product announcements, powerful keynote speakers, inspiring stories, more education, and more science. It’s important to know the Convention is not just for those who have chosen to create an essential oil business. Like everything in dōTERRA, the focus is on EDUCATION, so it’s a perfect event for customers and business builders alike. If you’re interested in attending with us, comment on this post and we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop!

Here’s the exciting news!! This year, doTERRA’s Convention will be held online and we want you to be there!! For all the information you need, check out Pursue 2020.
