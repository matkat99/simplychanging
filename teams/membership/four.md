After watching the video, do you feel like you understand the Loyalty Rewards Program and how it works? Any questions??

LRP orders are hands-down the favorite of our monthly subscriptions. We order our shampoo, soap, vitamins, etc on the LRP because we want high quality products in our homes and because it allows us to earn lots of free products. Here are some other things we love about it

1. We get to change our orders each month based on what we need.
2. We love that every 3 months that you are a consistent customer with a minimum of a 50PV order, you move up 5% in your savings! And that continues to go up every 3 months until you reach the amazing 30% back!
3. When you are earning 30% back on everything you buy, these points add up FAST and you get a TON of free stuff. It’s AWESOME!
4. Ordering ANYTHING, even 1PV will essentially “hold your place” with your points and percentages. You won’t earn new points or grow forward on that percentage scale, but you also won’t LOSE any points or slide BACKWARDS. A 50 PV monthly order allows you to EARN LRP points and move FORWARD on the scale where you grow from 10% to 15% and all the way up to 30% back on everything you buy. More questions?
