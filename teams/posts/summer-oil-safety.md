Did you know that some oils can cause skin sensitivity in the sun?

We want to make sure you are aware that some of your familyâ€™s favorite oils should be avoided topically before direct sunlight or exposure to artificial UV rays. Photosensitivity and phototoxicity apply to topical use of essential oils only and do not pose the same risks when used internally. When using a photosensitive essential oil topically, avoidance of sunlight is recommended for up to 12 hours after use.
