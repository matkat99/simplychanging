Welcome to Continuing Education! We are so excited for you to continue to learn how to use your oils and to learn about all the amazing products that doTERRA has to offer us. We invite you to start with Week 1, then feel free to watch the others in whatever order youâ€™d like. When you are done watching all the videos, please reach out to Keri or Aubrey and we will send you a fun GIFT.

The oil/product education on each video is about 30 minutes long. The last 15 minutes of each video we open up to sharing experiences with the oils and questions.
