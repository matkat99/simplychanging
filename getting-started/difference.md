doTERRA is such an amazing company and we are certain that as you learn more about their incredibly high standards for growing and harvesting the plants that give us our essential oils and all the good they are doing, that you will feel proud to be apart of this global movement.

We love that purity is doTERRA’s first priority when producing essential oils. You and your family deserve to have the purest essential oils in your home. When an essential oil is adulterated or contaminated, it becomes less effective and can even be dangerous.

To ensure that each bottle of essential oil is pure and free from contaminants or synthetic fillers, doTERRA created the CPTG Certified Pure Therapeutic Grade® protocol. The [CPTG process](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/cptg-testing-process) includes a rigorous examination of every batch of oil, along with third-party testing to guarantee transparency.

One of the many things that sets doTERRA apart is their Co-Impact Sourcing model. doTERRA works hand in hand with the farmers, harvesters, and distillers who contribute to their oil production. They ensure that small scale farmers are treated ethically by providing on-time payments at fair prices, something other oil companies don’t do. Growers and harvesters are encouraged and taught how to form cooperatives which greatly benefit all the growers in the area.
