As you dive into using your essential oils, we want to make sure that you know how to use them safely. First, doTERRA essential oils are potent and powerful. When using essential oils, less is best. For most applications, all you need is 1-2 drops. When using oils with kids, or anyone with sensitive skin, you will often want to add a carrier oil so as to dilute the essential oil.

**SAFETY TIP**: If you get essential oils into your eyes, it will sting. Do NOT flush with water. Grab a carrier oil (fractionated coconut oil, olive oil, or even vegetable oil) and with your eyes closed, rub the carrier oil around your eye in a circular motion until the pain stops (usually less than a minute- unless you had oils on your hand and put your contacts in, then it could take 2-3 minutes). This has happened to the best of us. ðŸ™‚

When using an essential oil, **make sure to read the label** to find out how the oil can be used: topically, aromatically and/or internally. **Not all of doTERRAâ€™s oils can be taken internally.** The oils that you can take internally have supplement facts on the bottle. Watch the video and check out the infographics to learn tips on how to use your oils safely and effectively. To learn about how to use essential oils aromatically, check out our [Diffusing Essential Oils](/pages/diffusing/) page. Have questions? We are here to help you have a great essential experience.

When looking up essentials oils on doTERRAâ€™s website, you will see these symbols to help guide you in how to use and apply that particular oil.

## Where Do I Apply My Oils?

- Area of Concern- General Rule of Thumb- apply directly to problem area or as close as you can get, avoiding mucus membranes
- Pulse Points- neck, wrists, temples, over heart, ankles
- F.E.W Spots- Feet, Ears, Wrists (never apply oils directly inside of ears, only on the outside around the ears, or on a cotton ball that can then be placed in the ear)
- Reflexology- applying oils to specific areas on the feet or ears to reach certain locations in the body.
- Never apply oils in ears, eyes or nose.

## Where to Use Oils Topically

- **Arms**: Massage onto arms after a long day to promote relaxation: Try Lavender, Frankincense, Deep Blue, Petitgrain, Balance and AromaTouch.
- **Bottom of Feet**: The pores on the feet are thicker than other pores on your body, which allows essential oils to be absorbed more quickly. Most oils can be applied on the feet. For a restful nightâ€™s sleep, try Serenity, Lavender, Roman Chamomile, Vetiver, Petitgrain and Marjoram.

Some essential oils are warm to the skin and need to be diluted with a carrier oil, like fractionated coconut oil. These particular oils should always be diluted.

## How to Use Essential Oils Internally

- Add to beverages
- Put a few drops in a doTERRA Veggie Capsule
- Put a drop directly under your tongue
- Take doTERRA essential oil supplements
- Use in favorite [recipes](/tags/cooking-fun)

### Tips on Taking Essential Oils Internally

- Follow recommended directions for use. Refer to doTERRA.com for product information pages and follow instructions for recommended use. Consult your physician if needed.
- Always start with one drop. As you become familiar with each essential oil and observe your bodyâ€™s response to it, you can slowly increase the number of drops until you achieve the desired results.
