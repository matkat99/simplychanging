Now that you have your essential oils, itâ€™s time to have some fun. Creating different blends of essential oils can be very empowering and a lot of fun. Whether you mix up your own rollerballs or attend one of our rollerball classes, the possibilities are endless. If you havenâ€™t attended one of our rollerball events, make sure to ask us about them.

## Supplies

You can purchase rollerballs online from doTERRA, on Amazon, or from a health food store. Weâ€™ve found that prices are cheaper when purchased online, but that does require some planning ahead. So if you need a rollerball now, check out your local health food store. You will also need Fractionated Coconut Oil (FCO), which can be purchased directly from doTERRA. You can make your own labels with a label maker or an address label. You can also find labels online.
