You might be a little surprised to see “Renewal Fee” listed as a membership perk, but this is for real!

When it’s time to renew your membership, it’s only TWENTY-FIVE dollars instead of the original $35. Nice, right?? But here’s the really cool part. Every year on your membership anniversary, you’ll receive a 15ml bottle of peppermint, totally FREE!! That’s a $20.50 oil, so it’s kind of like your membership renewal is less than $5. Woo-hoo!!!
