We’ve been talking about some of the generous programs dōTERRA has in place for us as customers. Regular product promos, the Loyalty Rewards Program, Product of the Month, and so on. One of our favorite things about dōTERRA is their commitment to the [Healing Hands Foundation](https://www.doterra.com/US/en/healing-hands-foundation-about). As doTERRA members, we consider the opportunity to be involved in Healing Hands a definite membership perk. Here are 3 things we love about it:

1. Projects that make a real difference. When you give to a cause you believe in, you want to feel safe that your money is going where you think it is and not to something dishonest or even fraudulent. The projects doTERRA supports through Healing Hands are all vetted projects with well-established and legitimate needs.
2. Humanitarian Service Trips. Another REALLY COOL thing dōTERRA does is organize humanitarian service trips that we as members can participate in! They coordinate all the projects, the travel, the details, and you can just show up and serve. We will warn you, these projects fill up really quickly so plan ahead! For more information, look under the “Our Caring” tab on dōTERRA’s website.
3. Accountability. Healing Hands produces powerful results in the lives of the people it serves. As dōTERRA members, we get regular updates about the projects that are going on and the impact they’re having around the world. It’s pretty incredible to be sitting at Convention watching a video of girls in Somaliland having the opportunity to attend school for the first time because of the partnerships and resources dōTERRA has brought to their village. To realize that, in some small but very tangible way, I contributed to that. I helped those girls on their path to a better life. An educated life. A safer life. That’s a win for all of us.

Here’s a quick taste of what we mean.
