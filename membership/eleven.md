Another HUGE perk of joining dōTERRA is the community of like-minded people that come with it. There is so much power in community!! We believe that the world is ready and waiting for more amazing things to happen and we invite you to join us in being apart of it. We are committed to You!

We are so thrilled to welcome you to our doTERRA family, and we hope you feel at home here.

But here’s the thing, you guys. There are SO MANY PEOPLE in the world who are looking for answers. People who are struggling, people who are hurting. Mamas who are in tears every day searching for ways to help their children. Grown children who are doing everything in their power to ease the suffering of their aging parents. People are searching for answers, they are desperate for options, they are craving support and a community who can help them. We can’t promise that we have the answers to everything, but we do know that since each one of us had found dōTERRA we have felt HOPE. We have felt like we now have CHOICES. We have felt EMPOWERED. That’s why we do what we do, and we want that feeling for everyone in the world. So now what we want to ask you is this:

- Who do you know?
- Who do you know who has a child struggling with frustration and anger?
- Who do you know who is pregnant and looking for safe and natural options?
- Who do you know who is an athlete and needs support for muscles and joints?
- Who do you know who is really health conscious and focused on prevention?
- Who do you know who struggles with feelings of anxiety, stress, or sadness?
- Who do you know who struggles to afford traditional health care, who wants safer, more affordable options they can utilize at home?
- Who do you know who feels limited because of a health challenge they haven’t been able to resolve?
- Who do you know who needs answers?
  We invite you to take a minute to write down the names of the people who came to mind, so you don’t forget them. There are people in your life who are wondering where to turn, and we’d love to help them. To invite them into our community of essential oil users to find answers. To find HOPE. To be EMPOWERED.

Who needs to know what you know?
