Every month, doTERRA offers a different product at an extra 10% off (on top of your 25% discount!)

And they also offer some pretty AWESOME product promotions. For example, in December they were offering a free 15ml bottle of FRANKINCENSE with any and every 200pv order. That’s a $69 oil (at the WHOLESALE cost), and you got it for FREE!! There will be more cool promos coming up. doTERRA also runs some amazing BOGO specials that you don’t want to miss out on.

Now, PV is important. It stands for PERSONAL VOLUME, and every product has PV assigned to it. doTERRA runs all of their product promotions, sales, deals, commissions, EVERYTHING based on the PV rather than the dollar amount. We are an international company so this makes it simple to set values on the products and then adjust as needed for different currencies. You’ll want to keep an eye out for the PV amount associated with the promotion and match your order to that!

I know what you’re thinking…how do I know when these deals are happening?? Here are 3 easy ways to stay in the loop:

1. Check your email! doTERRA sends an email at the beginning of the month announcing all promos.
2. Log in to your account! You’ll notice a banner ad that always has the current promotions displayed.
3. Stay tuned in to our team Facebook group! We’ll post the specials there so you never miss a chance to save some money.
