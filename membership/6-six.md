Let’s talk about shipping for a minute. To alleviate some of our shipping costs, dōTERRA instituted the Shipping Rewards Program. Here’s how it works.

If you place a LOYALTY REWARDS ORDER (vs a Standard Order), and it is done ONLINE (rather than calling customer service), you will get 100% of your shipping costs deposited into your account in the form of product points. It isn’t exactly free shipping, but it almost feels like it!

And the really cool part is that no matter HOW much you spend on shipping (whether standard or expedited), 100% of that cost will be credited back to you. These free points will be added to your account automatically, you don’t need to do anything special to take advantage of it.

When you add Shipping Reward Points to your regular Loyalty Reward Points, your free stuff accumulates pretty quickly! And that means you can “buy” things like Frankincense and Melissa without spending a dime.
