doTERRA’s customer service is amazing! If you ever have a question about an order, an issue with your account, need help understanding your commission checks, have questions about the ingredients in products, essential oil sourcing, corporate education events, and so much more, call them!!

As your upline support team, we are here to help you in any way we can, but our specialty is product education and usage tips. For questions with your account, like:

- “When is my membership going to renew?”
- “I don’t see my LRP points yet, when are they going to show up in my account?”
- “One of my bottles leaked in shipping…”

Customer Service is much better equipped to help you! (And in all honesty, they’ll get you answers faster than we could!) They’re incredibly friendly, very helpful, and always eager to make things right. And you can use their Online Chat feature if you don’t want to wait on the phone.
