Have you ever wondered where we get our rich, earthy Vetiver Oil?

Vetiver essential oil has a wonderful strong earthy scent that comes from roots that grow deep into the ground. Vetiver has been used in the perfume industry for a long time. Vetiver is a very calming soothing and relaxing oil. It is great to use after a long stressful day to help promote relaxation and better sleep. It is also used to aid your immune system. You can apply topically or take internally in a capsule. Vetiver is a very thick oil and is best used with a dropper.

doTERRA started sourcing their vetiver oil in February 2014 from Les Cayes, Haiti. It can take 16-18 months for the roots to develop before being dug our of the ground and then the roots are beaten to loosen the dirt that clings to them. Through the co-Impact sourcing doTERRA has helped the farmers form cooperatives and helped provide training so they can help produce the worlds highest grade of essential oils.

They Healing Hands Foundation helped bring running water to the village that not only provided clean water but elimated the long 3 hour round trip journey down and back up the mountain each day to provide water for the village. This daily trip was being made by young children. The Healing Hands Foundation also has helped build schools to educate the children of the villages. doTERRA truly cares to change the lives of those who help provide these pure essential oils.
