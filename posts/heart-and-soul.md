doTERRA’s mission is to “Source the Best and Help the Most”. The heartbeat of doTERRA is helping others. Every time you use these essential oils, you are helping families around the world.

There are 2 things that set doTERRA apart in the essential oil industry. The first is testing and the other is their mission. doTERRA works diligently to make a difference. Their mission is to change the world one drop, one person, one community at a time. One of the ways they do this is through [responsible sourcing](https://sourcetoyou.com/en) of essential oils.

Not all essential oils are created equal. Most companies choose to cut costs by using low-quality plants or adulterate their oils with cheap substances. While cutting corners might save an essential oil company time and money, it will result in a low-quality oil. Unfortunately, many of the production methods in the essential oil industry can also be harmful to the environment or result in the unfair treatment of farmers and growers.

Every oil sold by doTERRA is responsibly and sustainably sourced. doTERRA focuses on sourcing practices that will produce only the highest quality essential oils—no matter the cost. They make it a top priority to protect the environment during the production process and provide fair treatment of all harvesters and growers.
