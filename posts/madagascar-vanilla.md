Did you know that farmers have to hand-pollinate each Vanilla orchid on the one day of the year it blooms?

After hand-pollination, Vanilla beans take 8—9 months to fully develop.
Our partnership is focused on traceability, sustainability, and ethical production in Madagascar. Through Cō-Impact Sourcing®, the dōTERRA Healing Hands Foundation® supported the funding of the Mahadera Agricultural Training Center. This center, built and operated by our partners, offers a three-year farm training for the children of Vanilla farmers, which teaches important skills, such as crop diversification and financial management. This training provides access to further education opportunities and a more secure future, for themselves and their families.

Madagascar Vanilla from doTERRA is a pure absolute, prediluted with Fractionated Coconut Oil for convenient topical application. That said, you can use it more than topically—you’ll be hard-pressed to find a diffuser blend that doesn’t smell even more amazing with a drop of Madagascar Vanilla.

Along with diffuser blends, Madagascar Vanilla is ideal for mixing with personal care products or making a part of topical fragrances. Its distinctly sweet, familiar aroma is beloved like few other scents!
Adding Madagascar Vanilla to a beverage, like your morning tea or smoothie, provides some extra delicious flavor. As it’s an absolute, Madagascar Vanilla is more potent than the vanilla extract you may be used to, so you’ll only need one drop!

### Usage Tips:

- Add a drop to your next diffuser blend.
- Include a drop or two in your personal pure-fume.
- Use a drop with your personal care products, like shampoos, conditioners, lotions, or creams.
- Add one drop to a smoothie
