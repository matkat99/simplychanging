Have you ever wondered what gives this oil it’s blue hue?

The oil of the Blue Tansy plant belongs to a group called the chamomile oils, which also includes Roman Chamomile and German Chamomile. As you may know, Blue Tansy is sometimes referred to as “Moroccan Blue Chamomile.” What each of the chamomile oils has in common is the presence of a compound called chamazulene. Chamazulene’s intense blue color is what gives all the chamomile oils their hue. Interestingly enough, chamazulene is actually formed during steam distillation, which explains why the oils are blue but the plants they come from are not.
